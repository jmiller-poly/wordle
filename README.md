# wordle

May 31, 2023

I'm going to keep working on this, the github is here: https://github.com/jmiller-poly/wordle
But I'm turning in this version, because its the amount I got finished in class.

Last year, I created the logic for simplistic wordle, so this year I decided to make a graphic
interface for it. After a little research, I decided to do this with tkinter, but I didn't know
how difficult that would be. With a lot of googling, I eventually found the basics of how to 
make a window that looked the way I wanted it. My most significant challenge was getting
everything placed where I wanted it, because I had been using the .grid() method, but .place()
proved much more helpful after I learned how to use it. Right now, I haven't figured out a 
keyboard input, but I am able to get input from the buttons on screen, so I will be able to
apply the logic to that first, and then work on keyboard input at a later date.
